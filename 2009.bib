abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new content-based publish/subscribe (pub/sub) framework that enables a pub/sub system to accommodate richer content formats including multimedia publications with image and video content. The pub/sub system besides being responsible for matching and routing the published content, is also responsible for converting the content into the suitable (target) format for each subscriber. Content conversion is achieved through a set of content adaptation operators (e.g., image transcoder, document translator, etc.) at different nodes in the overlay network. We study algorithms for placement of such operators in the pub/sub broker overlay in order to minimize the communication and computation resource consumption. Our experimental results show that careful placement of these operators in pub/sub overlay network can lead to significant cost reduction.},

abstract = {Middleware for pervasive spaces has to meet conflicting requirements. It has to both maximize the utility of the information exposed and ensure that this information does not violate users' privacy. In order to resolve these conflicts, we propose a framework grounded in utility theory where users dynamically control the level of disclosure about their information. We begin by providing appropriate definitions of privacy and utility for the type of applications that would support collaborative work in an office environment---current definitions of privacy and anonymity do not apply in this context. We propose a distributed solution that, given a user's background knowledge, maximizes the utility of the information being disclosed to information recipients while meeting the privacy requirements of users. We implement our solution in the context of a real pervasive space middleware and provide experiments that demonstrate its behaviour.},

abstract = {This paper presents a reflective middleware architecture for simulation integration based on structural reflection and metamodel concepts. The proposed architecture extracts the simulator information as metamodels from the base-level simulators, determines the required features and modules using semantic constraints, and reflects the modified features to the base- level. It is shown that the reflective middleware architecture addresses various challenges in simulation integration. It also enables a design that is more adaptable, flexible and easier to extend. We present a detailed case study from the emergency response domain, where simulations are critical, to illustrate the potential benefits of applying the proposed architecture.},

abstract = {One of the main challenges faced by content-based publish/subscribe systems is handling large amount of dynamic subscriptions and publications in a multidimensional content space. To reduce subscription forwarding load and speed up content matching, subscription covering, subsumption and merging techniques have been proposed. In this paper we propose MICS, Multidimensional Indexing for Content Space that provides an efficient representation and processing model for large number of subscriptions and publications. MICS creates a one dimensional representation for publications and subscriptions using Hilbert space filling curve. Based on this representation, we propose novel content matching and subscription management (covering, subsumption and merging) algorithms. Our experimental evaluation indicates that the proposed approach significantly speeds up subscription management operations compared to the naive linear approach.},

abstract={This paper deals with the problem of reliable and fast broadcast of mission-critical data with rich content over ad hoc networks. Existing approaches to dissemination reliability often assume network size knowledge, or that receivers know about the dissemination in advance. Without making similar assumptions, we propose a distinct approach which accommodates the varying reliability needs of applications. We develop the RADcast (reliable application data broadcast) protocol as an integration of two components: (a) Peddler, which ensures that receivers obtain the dissemination metadata, and (b) Pryer, which delivers the actual data to dissemination-aware receivers. We indicate how reliability guarantees/performance tradeoffs can be achieved by a careful instantiation of Peddler and Pryer. We implement RADcast on mobile devices inside a middleware and determine its feasibility. Furthermore, through extensive simulations, we show that RADcast achieves desired reliability in all cases, and performs consistently under varying network conditions and device mobilities. As compared to existing approaches, RADcast either incurs significantly lower latency/message overhead, or reduces latency by 50% with a tradeoff in message overhead.},

abstract={The demand for video content is continuously increasing as video sharing on the Internet is becoming enormously popular recently. This demand, with its high bandwidth requirements, has a considerable impact on the load of the network infrastructure. As more users access videos from their mobile devices, the load on the current wireless infrastructure (which has limited capacity) will be even more significant. Based on observations from many local video sharing scenarios, in this paper, we study the tradeoffs of using Wi-Fi ad-hoc mode versus infrastructure mode for video streaming between adjacent devices. We thus show the potential of direct device-to-device communication as a way to reduce the load on the wireless infrastructure and to improve user experiences. Setting up experiments for Wi- Fi devices connected in ad-hoc mode, we collect measurements for various video streaming scenarios and compare them to the case where the devices are connected through access points. The results show the improvements in latency, jitter and loss rate. More importantly, the results show that the performance in direct device-to-device streaming is much more stable in contrast to the access point case, where different factors affect the performance causing widely unpredictable qualities.},
