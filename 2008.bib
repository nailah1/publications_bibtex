abstract = {Real-time multimedia applications are increasingly being mapped onto MPSoC (multiprocessor system-on-chip) platforms containing hardware--software IPs (intellectual property), along with a library of common scheduling policies such as EDF, RM. The choice of a scheduling policy for each IP is a key decision that greatly affects the design's ability to meet real-time constraints, and also directly affects the energy consumed by the design. We present a cosynthesis framework for design space exploration that considers heterogeneous scheduling while mapping multimedia applications onto such MPSoCs. In our approach, we select a suitable scheduling policy for each IP such that system energy is minimized—our framework also includes energy-reduction techniques utilizing dynamic power management. Experimental results on a realistic multimode multimedia terminal application demonstrate that our approach enables us to select design points with up to 60.5% reduced energy for a given area constraint, while meeting all real-time requirements. More importantly, our approach generates a tradeoff space between energy and cost allowing designers to comparatively evaluate multiple system level mappings.},

abstract={We present cluster-based publish/subscribe, a novel architecture that is not only resilient to event broker failures but also provides load balancing and fast event dissemination service. Our proposed approach achieves fault tolerance by organizing event brokers in clusters. Multiple inter-cluster links provide continuous availability of dissemination service in presence of broker failure without requiring subscription retransmission or reconstruction of broker overlay. Furthermore, the proposed architecture provides a fast event dissemination infrastructure that significantly reduces subscription and publication dissemination traffic and load on event brokers. Our experimental results show that even in the presence of failures in broker network, event dissemination is not interrupted and dissemination speed and load are significantly improved compared to the existing approached.},  keywords={message passing;middleware;resource allocation;software fault tolerance;content-based publish/subscribe architecture;event broker failures;load balancing;event dissemination service;fault tolerance;Subscriptions;Clustering algorithms;Routing;Computer architecture;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Organizing;Publish/Subscribe;Event-based Systems;Notification Dissemination},

abstract = {Adaptive resource management is critical to ensuring the quality of real-time multimedia communication, particularly for energy-constrained mobile handheld devices. In this context, a holistic cross-layer optimization considering multiple layers (e.g., application, middleware, operating system) needs to be developed for continuous adaptation of system parameters. This thesis proposes a unified framework that employs iterative policy/parameter tuning by combining light-weight, on-the-fly formal verification with feedback for dynamic adaptation. The integration of formal analysis with dynamic behavior from system execution will result in a feedback loop that enables model refinement and further optimization of policies and parameters. Our unified framework tunes the parameters in a compositional manner allowing coordinated interaction among sub-layer optimizers that enables holistic cross-layer optimization.},

abstract = {Exponentially increasing with technology scaling, soft errors have become a serious design concern in the deep sub-micron embedded systems. Partially Pro-tected Cache (PPC) is a promising microarchitectural feature to mitigate failures due to soft errors in embedded processors. A processor with PPC maintains two caches, one protected and the other unprotected, both at the same level of memory hierarchy. By finding out the data more prone to soft errors and mapping only that to the protected cache, the failure rate can be significantly improved at minimal power and performance penalty. While the effectiveness of PPCs has been demonstrated on multimedia applications -- where the multimedia data is inherently resilient to soft errors -- no such obvious data partitioning exists for applications in general. This paper proposes profile-based data partitioning schemes that are applicable to applications in general and effectively reduce failures due to soft errors at mini-mal power and performance overheads. Our experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm reduces the failure rate by 47on benchmarks from MiBench while incurring only 0.5% performance and 15% power overheads.},

abstract = {Energy/QoS provisioning is a challenging task for video applications in power-constrained mobile embedded systems. Many error-resilient video encodings allow us to exploit errors and generate a range of acceptable tradeoff spaces by controlling the amount of errors in the system. This expanded tradeoff space allows system designers to comparatively evaluate different operating points with varying QoS and energy consumption by aggressively exploiting error-resilience attributes, and can potentially result in significant energy savings. Specifically, we propose an error-aware video encoding technique that intentionally injects errors (drops frames) while ensuring QoS in accordance with error-resilience. The novelty of our approach is in active exploitation of errorsto vary the operating conditions for further optimization of system aspects. Our experiments show that our error-exploiting video encoding can reduce the energy consumption for an encoding device by 37{\{}{\%}{\}} in video conferencing over a wireless network, without video quality degradation, compared to a standard video encoding technique for a test video stream. Furthermore, we present the adaptivity of our approach by incorporating the feedback from the decoding side to achieve the QoS requirement under dynamic network status.},

abstract={This paper addresses the issue of proxy-based data placement for mobile applications. The key idea is to use aggregated information about mobile users and their data request patterns to determine when, how frequently and how much data to be replicated on proxies. Specifically, we introduce a novel representation, mobile data overlay (MDO) that captures aggregated mobile data access patterns. The underlying representation of the MDO utilizes an interval tree-based data structure in supporting efficient spatio-temporal operations on mobile data access information. We develop intelligent MDO reconfiguration (ReC-MDO) techniques that help determine proper granularity of data replication operation (i.e. appropriate segmentation of each data object) by extracting spatio-temporal locality of mobile data access patterns. The ReC-MDO approach effectively balances tradeoffs between replication cost and data access cost in making mobile data placement decisions on proxies. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the superiority of our techniques over several popular data placement strategies.},  keywords={data structures;feature extraction;mobile radio;trees (mathematics);mobile data overlay;proxy-based data placement;information aggregation;mobile data access patterns;interval tree-based data structure;spatiotemporal operations;intelligent reconfiguration techniques;data replication operation;spatiotemporal locality extraction;mobile data placement decisions;Costs;Mobile computing;Network servers;Conference management;Application software;Resource management;Streaming media;Tree data structures;Data mining;Delay},
