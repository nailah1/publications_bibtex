  abstract={We present cluster-based publish/subscribe, a novel architecture that is not only resilient to event broker failures but also provides load balancing and fast event dissemination service. Our proposed approach achieves fault tolerance by organizing event brokers in clusters. Multiple inter-cluster links provide continuous availability of dissemination service in presence of broker failure without requiring subscription retransmission or reconstruction of broker overlay. Furthermore, the proposed architecture provides a fast event dissemination infrastructure that significantly reduces subscription and publication dissemination traffic and load on event brokers. Our experimental results show that even in the presence of failures in broker network, event dissemination is not interrupted and dissemination speed and load are significantly improved compared to the existing approached.},

abstract = {Real-time multimedia applications are increasingly being mapped onto MPSoC (multiprocessor system-on-chip) platforms containing hardware--software IPs (intellectual property), along with a library of common scheduling policies such as EDF, RM. The choice of a scheduling policy for each IP is a key decision that greatly affects the design's ability to meet real-time constraints, and also directly affects the energy consumed by the design. We present a cosynthesis framework for design space exploration that considers heterogeneous scheduling while mapping multimedia applications onto such MPSoCs. In our approach, we select a suitable scheduling policy for each IP such that system energy is minimizedâ€”our framework also includes energy-reduction techniques utilizing dynamic power management. Experimental results on a realistic multimode multimedia terminal application demonstrate that our approach enables us to select design points with up to 60.5% reduced energy for a given area constraint, while meeting all real-time requirements. More importantly, our approach generates a tradeoff space between energy and cost allowing designers to comparatively evaluate multiple system level mappings.},
